To add storylet support to your project...

Add the following line to your core ink file.

	INCLUDE patches/storylets.ink
	
Export your story from Inky by clicking "File", then "Export for web...". This will generate a folder for your project.

Drag the extensions folder here into your project's folder.

Add the following line immediately below "<script src="ink.js"></script>" in index.html.

	<script src="patches/storylets.js"></script>
	
In future, you can use "Export story.js only..." if you need to make changes to your ink.
