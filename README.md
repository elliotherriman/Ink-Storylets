# Ink Storylets
A modified version of ink's web player that adds support for basic storylets. If you're not familiar with storylets, can learn more here. 

To use, either click "Export for web..." inside Inky, and then follow the instructions included to modify your new project folder, or use "Export story.js only..." to save your compiled Ink to the template folder included here. 

Unfortunately, this code doesn't add storylet support to the app Inky â€” it only adds support to the ink web player you can export from Inky. Storylets just won't appear in the Inky preview player. This is normal, if unfortunate, but your storylets should still appear as expected in this modified web player.

If you're using this for InkJam 2021, please do a quick test to make sure storylets are working for you before committing. And please make sure you check back here before releasing your game. Odds are, I'll have released some bug fixes.
